THE LORD'S PRAYER:

OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME
THY KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS
IN HEAVEN,
AND GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD. AND FORGIVE US OUR
TRESSPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THOSE WHO TRESSPASS AGAINST US
AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL

FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, THE POWER, AND THE GLORY
BOTH NOW AND FOREVER...AMEN

- JESUS CHRIST
