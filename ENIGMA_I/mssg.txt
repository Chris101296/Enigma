Our Father who art in heavem, hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come, thy will be done one Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil

-Jesus Christ

For the Kingdom and the power and the glory are yours now and forever
